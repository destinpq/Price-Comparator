# Changes Made to Price Comparison Scrapers

## Interface Updates

### ScraperResult Interface (in index.ts)
- Added `originalPrice?: string | null` field to track original prices before discounts
- Added `discount?: string | null` field to track discount percentage or amount

### Scraper Consistency
- Updated DMart and Instamart scrapers to use `ScrapedResult` from blinkit.ts instead of `ScraperResult` from index.ts
- Fixed return value handling in DMart and Instamart to properly convert null values to undefined

## Feature Enhancements

### Pincode Support
- Verified that all six scrapers properly handle the pincode parameter:
  - Blinkit: Uses pincode for location-based search
  - Zepto: Uses pincode for location-based search  
  - BigBasket: Uses pincode for location-based search
  - JioMart: Uses pincode for location-based search
  - DMart: Uses pincode for location-based search
  - Instamart: Uses pincode for location-based search

### Discount and Original Price Support
- Added detection of original prices (displayed with strikethrough) in all scrapers
- Added detection of discount information in all scrapers
- Enhanced product selection logic to favor actual products over similar names

### UI Selector Updates
- Updated selectors in all scrapers to properly handle modern Tailwind CSS-based selectors
- Added fallback selectors to maintain compatibility with older designs

## Verification
- Successfully verified all interface and function changes using static analysis
- Confirmed all scrapers use correct parameter and return types
- Ensured implementation consistency across all scrapers

These changes ensure that all scrapers can handle location-based results properly and display complete pricing information (including discounts) when available. When deployed in production, the application will provide users with more detailed product information for better comparison across all supported grocery platforms.
